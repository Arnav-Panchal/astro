- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0), almost white, providing a neutral backdrop to emphasize the indigo accents and create a clean, professional appearance.
- Accent color: Gold (#FFD700), used sparingly to highlight important elements like notification icons and payment buttons, symbolizing value and celestial insight.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a humanist serif font, offering a blend of elegance and contemporary style.
- Use elegant, minimalist line icons representing astrological symbols, notifications, and payment methods.
- Subtle animations, such as a gentle pulsating effect on the notification icon or a smooth transition between chat messages, enhancing user engagement without distraction.
